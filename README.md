# Aphasia Speech Assistant

What is Aphasia?
> Aphasia is a neurological language disorder caused by damage to the brain's language centers, typically in the left hemisphere, resulting in impaired ability to communicate, speak, read, write, and understand language

What does this do?
> People suffering from Aphasia usually need to spend thousands of dollars on speech coaches that patiently listen and converse with patients. This is a AI-powered replacement to that, which listens and has been carefully prompt-engineered to cater the needs of Aphasia patients- like understanding random word splurts, removing filler words etc. It also has sentence exercises, along with the ability to retrieve the pronunciation of each word.

## Features

- Accessible and minimalist UI: This is a useful feature as many patients are old, and do not know their way around technology.
- Text to speech and speech to text.
- Clickable exercise-words, which you can find the pronunciation of.

## How to use?

Everything is super intuitive. In order to use the word-pronunciation feature, click on each specific word from the exercises.
